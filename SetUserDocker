Create a Non-Root User
Ensure that a non-root user is created and available for operations within the environment. This can be done during image or environment initialization.
Example in a Dockerfile:  RUN chown myuser:myuser /desired-directory
Switch to Non-Root User
Adjust the runtime user context for the environment.
Example in a Dockerfile: USER myuser
Grant Necessary Permissions
Modify the permissions for the directories and files that the user needs to access.
Example: RUN useradd -m myuser
